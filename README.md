# StudyBot

a multimodal chatbot designed to help students in their studies, it can handle multiple formats such as pdf files, images and audio files. For the pdf file handling i use RAG , and similarity searchs, to help generate a speicifc awnser.

I used 3 diffrent models for each functionality, 
for generating text i used the quantized version of the mistral-7b model, for audio i used whipserai, and for images i used the llava modal from llama.






## Tech Stack
